## Project Name
UL Panel Web App for Building Electrical Safety in Cote Dâ€™ivoire.

## Project Description
The UL Panel Web App is an online calculator designed to help UL Panel Shops in Cote d'Ivoire design electrical panels that adhere to the guidelines outlined in the UL Specification 508A. The app provides a user-friendly interface that allows panel designers to input all the necessary parameters required to design a UL-compliant panel. Using the UL Panel Web App, designers can select various components such as circuit breakers, transformers, switches, and other electrical devices required for their panel design. The app will automatically calculate the required electrical specifications based on the selected components and provide a detailed report that outlines the power and current requirements, component ratings, and other critical design specifications.

## Installation and Usage
To use the UL Panel Web App, simply visit the website and create an account. Once logged in, you can start designing your UL-compliant electrical panel. The app will guide you through the selection of components and provide automatic calculations of electrical specifications. When you are satisfied with your design, the app will generate a detailed report outlining the design specifications and component ratings. 

## Features
- Component Selection: The app allows panel designers to select various components required for their panel design, such as circuit breakers, transformers, switches, and other electrical devices.
- Automatic Calculation: The app automatically calculates the required electrical specifications based on the selected components, including power and current requirements, component ratings, and other critical design specifications.
- Compliance Checking: The app checks the design against the UL Specification 508A guidelines to ensure that the panel complies with all relevant safety standards.
- Design Report: The app generates a detailed report outlining the design specifications, component ratings, and other critical details required for the design.
- User Management: The app allows for multiple user accounts with varying levels of access to the design process and report generation.

- Mobile Accessibility: The app is designed to be mobile-friendly and accessible on all devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones.
- Error Handling: The app provides helpful error messages and clear notifications to guide the user in case of any errors or mistakes during the design process.
